# DiscreetDial

DiDi, but with a GUI! Revolutionary. Doesn't get much better than this. There's really not a whole lot else to be excited for, people!

## TODO (string formatting, logic, etc.) 

### Slash Commands
Because DiDi has a strict keyboard only philosophy for some reason, we need to implement commands that can be invoked with "/". This will ensure that our app has all the functionality we want it to

### Binding enter to event
We need to bind "enter" to an event that not only sends the text from the input to the output, but also to the appropriate function depending on whether the user is connected to a server or not. We also need to write said functions, though this shouldn't be too bad since divejane has done that work in the cli

### Output text
We need to figure out how to make messages and just general output from DiDi to look good with just one text box because I'm too stubborn to make another one
